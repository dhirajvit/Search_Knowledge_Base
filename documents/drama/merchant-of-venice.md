🎭 The Merchant of Venice

by William Shakespeare

🌊 ACT 1 – Venice

Antonio, a wealthy merchant in Venice, feels strangely sad. He doesn’t know why. His friends Salerio and Solanio guess it’s because his ships are at sea, carrying valuable cargo. If they sink, he will lose everything.

But Antonio insists that’s not it.

His close friend Bassanio arrives. Bassanio is charming, noble — and broke. He confesses he wants to marry Portia, a wealthy heiress in Belmont. But to compete with other suitors, he needs money.

Antonio has no cash — all his wealth is tied up in ships. So he offers to borrow money for Bassanio.

They approach Shylock, a Jewish moneylender. Antonio has insulted Shylock before, calling him a dog and criticizing his practice of charging interest.

Shylock pretends friendliness but secretly hates Antonio.

He agrees to lend 3,000 ducats for three months — with no interest.

But there is a condition:

If Antonio cannot repay the loan on time, Shylock may cut one pound of flesh from Antonio’s body.

Antonio laughs and agrees, confident his ships will return in time.

The bond is signed.

Shylock smiles — revenge is now legal.

💍 ACT 2 – Belmont & Venice

In Belmont, Portia discusses her situation. Her dead father left a strange will: any man who wants to marry her must choose correctly between three caskets:

Gold

Silver

Lead

Only one contains her portrait. Choosing correctly wins her hand.

Suitors arrive.

The Prince of Morocco chooses the gold casket — believing Portia is too valuable for lead.

Inside is a skull.

He loses.

The Prince of Arragon chooses silver — believing he deserves Portia.

He loses too.

Meanwhile in Venice, Shylock’s daughter Jessica secretly plans to run away with Lorenzo, a Christian friend of Bassanio.

She disguises herself as a boy and escapes her father’s house with money and jewels.

Shylock is devastated — not only because his daughter fled, but because she took his gold.

He cries out:
“My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!”

His pain mixes love and greed.

❤️ ACT 3 – The Choice & The Danger

In Belmont, Bassanio arrives to attempt the casket test.

He carefully considers the inscriptions.

Gold promises what “many men desire.”
Silver promises what he “deserves.”
Lead promises nothing — but demands everything.

Bassanio rejects surface beauty and chooses lead.

Inside is Portia’s portrait.

He has won her.

They exchange rings as symbols of eternal love.

At that moment, bad news arrives.

Antonio’s ships have been lost.
The bond has matured.
Shylock demands his pound of flesh.

Bassanio is horrified.

Portia tells him to go immediately to Venice to save his friend.

She secretly decides to follow.

⚖️ ACT 4 – The Courtroom

The most famous scene.

In a Venetian court, Antonio stands ready to die.

Shylock refuses money — even double or triple repayment.

He wants justice.

He wants revenge.

He sharpens his knife.

The Duke begs him to show mercy.

Shylock replies:

“If you deny me, fie upon your law!”

Portia arrives disguised as a young male lawyer named Balthazar.

She delivers a powerful speech about mercy:

“The quality of mercy is not strained…”

She urges Shylock to forgive.

He refuses.

She then carefully examines the bond.

It allows one pound of flesh.

But it does not allow a drop of blood.

If Shylock spills Christian blood, he will lose his wealth and life under Venetian law.

Shylock is trapped.

He tries to accept money instead.

Too late.

Portia declares he must either take exactly one pound without blood — or face punishment.

He cannot.

He is defeated.

The court orders:

He must give half his wealth to Antonio.

Convert to Christianity.

Leave his estate to his daughter Jessica and Lorenzo.

Shylock leaves broken.

💔 ACT 5 – Rings & Revelations

Back in Belmont, Portia and Nerissa (her maid, also disguised earlier) test their husbands.

While in Venice, Bassanio gave away his wedding ring to the “lawyer” (Portia in disguise).

Now Portia demands to know why he broke his promise.

After tension and teasing, she reveals the truth.

She was the lawyer.

All ends happily:

Antonio’s ships mysteriously return safely.

Lovers are reunited.

Jessica inherits Shylock’s wealth.
